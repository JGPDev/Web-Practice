                <p> In this project, I created a PowerBI data report for the logistics department for
                    Crane Army Ammunition Activity. I had to work with diverse group of interns (since
                    one of the goals of the intership was to introduce diversity into the workspace) and
                    be proactive to keep up with data changes. I learned how to use some tools like PowerBI,
                    Power Automate, and Power Query.
