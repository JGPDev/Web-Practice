    <h1>How The Earth Is</h1>
    <h3> Please understand that I am not a visual artist!. </h3>
    <p>Here's a simple little animation of how the earth is. Yup. <strong>It's flat.</strong>
    This is a <em><strong>very</strong></em> controvertial topic that would take hours of discussion,
    so I'm not going to do that here. I could give you lots of scientific proofs, but the most 
    important and powerful proof is The Word of God, that suggest a flat earth. For more information, you 
    can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1QP4-U0zlA">this video.</a></p>
